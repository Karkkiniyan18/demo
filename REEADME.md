Karkkiniyan,

I am very happy to know about you and feel proud to have you as my student. Scoring 94% in 10th and 91% in 12th shows your ability and hard work—you already have a strong foundation to shine in engineering.

It’s wonderful that you are passionate about cricket and artwork. These hobbies show that you are both active and creative, which will definitely help you in problem-solving and thinking differently in computer science.

Being introverted is never a weakness; it simply means you take time to open up. The way you become extroverted with your friends shows that you can balance both sides well. In engineering life, this balance will help you build good friendships and teamwork.

I believe with your consistency and positive attitude, you will surely succeed in your studies and future career. Stay confident, keep learning step by step, and I will always support you whenever you need guidance.

All the very best for your journey ahead!
